## Overview

This work took place during June 2024 in the SPICE Summer Data Science Institute. Students imported data from NOAA's [National Buoy Data Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/) onto the Texas Advanced Computing Center ([TACC](https://tacc.utexas.edu/)). Utilizing Python, some for the very first time, students cleaned the buoy data to train an ARIMA Model to eventually make predictions. Due to the size of the data, students learned how to utilize parrallel-processing in model training. Model accuracy was determined with R2 and MAE values.
